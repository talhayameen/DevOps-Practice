ClusterIP: This is the default service type in Kubernetes. It exposes the service on an internal IP address, 
NodePort: This service type exposes the service on a static port on each node in the cluster. It creates a mapping between the allocated port on each node and the service. 
LoadBalancer: This service type provisions an external load balancer (such as a cloud provider load balancer) that distributes incoming traffic to the service across multiple nodes. It automatically assigns an external IP address to the service,
ExternalName: This service type is used when you want to provide a DNS alias to an external service. Instead of exposing an internal service, ExternalName maps the service to a DNS name,

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /some/endpoint
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 10
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
